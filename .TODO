# Capture is a CLI tool written in Typescript for capturing structured text input into a local YAML file. I want to use this as the basis for some other CLI tools. Plus, I want some practice with Typescript and friends (tslint, mocha, nyc).

Capture:
  [] @code Write method to allow user to add question from command line 
  [] @code Write method to allow user to see list of questions from command line
  [] @code Write method to allow user to remove question from command line 
  [] @code Write method to allow user to answer question from command line
  [] @docs Write basic usage instructions
  [] @docs Write CLI --help
